# ECHOBACK-1996
1996, FidoNet BBS, Echo Back, written in Borland C with make files. This was a very nice utility back in the day, people on FidoNet could archives the messages in their inbound Echo folders, moving them out to make room for new messages while archiving the older ones. This was used a lot.
